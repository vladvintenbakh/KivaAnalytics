# Kiva Loans Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze the dataset provided by Kiva, a microfinance organization, to understand the distribution and impact of loans globally. The analysis aims to uncover insights that can help improve the distribution of loans and ensure a fairer allocation to communities in need. This will contribute to better financial inclusion and the economic empowerment of individuals in underserved regions.

## Project Description
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset from Kiva to explore the trends and patterns in loan distribution, the characteristics of borrowers, and the impact of loans across different countries. The data includes various attributes, such as loan amounts, borrower details, and geographical information. The objective is to gain insights into how Kiva's loans are distributed and identify areas that may require further attention or adjustment.

Key areas of focus include:
1. Analyzing loan distributions across countries and regions.
2. Identifying any potential disparities in loan allocation based on gender, sector, or region.
3. Visualizing key trends in borrower demographics.
4. Exploring the relationship between loan amounts and repayment periods.

## Project Needs

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. The `kiva_mpi_region_locations` dataset is being kept [here](https://github.com/vladvintenbakh/KivaAnalytics/blob/main/kiva_mpi_region_locations.csv) within this repo. Another dataset (`kiva_loans.csv`) can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding/download). The datasets used in this project were sourced from Kiva's open data repository and are publicly accessible.
3. The primary Jupyter notebook for the project is being kept [here](https://github.com/vladvintenbakh/KivaAnalytics/blob/main/Kiva_EDA.ipynb).
4. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and run the notebook.
